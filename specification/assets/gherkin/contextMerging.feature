Feature: Context merging precedence

  Background:
    Given a stable provider with retrievable context is registered

  Scenario Outline: A context entry is added to a single level
    Given A context entry with key "key" and value "value" is added to the "<level>" level
    When Some flag was evaluated
    Then The merged context contains an entry with key "key" and value "value"

    @Transaction
    Examples:
      | level       |
      | API         |
      | Transaction |
      | Client      |
      | Invocation  |

    @Hooks
    Examples:
      | level        |
      | API          |
      | Client       |
      | Invocation   |
      | Before Hooks |

  @Transaction
  Scenario: A context entry is added to each level with different keys
    Given A context entry with key "API" and value "API value" is added to the "API" level
    And A context entry with key "Transaction" and value "Transaction value" is added to the "Transaction" level
    And A context entry with key "Client" and value "Client value" is added to the "Client" level
    And A context entry with key "Invocation" and value "Invocation value" is added to the "Invocation" level
    When Some flag was evaluated
    Then The merged context contains an entry with key "API" and value "API value"
    And The merged context contains an entry with key "Transaction" and value "Transaction value"
    And The merged context contains an entry with key "Client" and value "Client value"
    And The merged context contains an entry with key "Invocation" and value "Invocation value"

  @Hooks
  Scenario: A context entry is added to each level with different keys
    Given A context entry with key "API" and value "API value" is added to the "API" level
    And A context entry with key "Client" and value "Client value" is added to the "Client" level
    And A context entry with key "Invocation" and value "Invocation value" is added to the "Invocation" level
    And A context entry with key "Before Hooks" and value "Before Hooks value" is added to the "Before Hooks" level
    When Some flag was evaluated
    Then The merged context contains an entry with key "API" and value "API value"
    And The merged context contains an entry with key "Client" and value "Client value"
    And The merged context contains an entry with key "Invocation" and value "Invocation value"
    And The merged context contains an entry with key "Before Hooks" and value "Before Hooks value"

  @Transaction
  Scenario Outline: A context entry in one level overwrites values with the same key from preceding levels
    Given A table with levels of increasing precedence
      | API         |
      | Transaction |
      | Client      |
      | Invocation  |
    And Context entries for each level from API level down to the "<level>" level, with key "key" and value "<level>"
    When Some flag was evaluated
    Then The merged context contains an entry with key "key" and value "<level>"

    Examples:
      | level       |
      | API         |
      | Transaction |
      | Client      |
      | Invocation  |

  @Hooks
  Scenario Outline: A context entry in one level overwrites values with the same key from preceding levels
    Given A table with levels of increasing precedence
      | API          |
      | Client       |
      | Invocation   |
      | Before Hooks |
    And Context entries for each level from API level down to the "<level>" level, with key "key" and value "<level>"
    When Some flag was evaluated
    Then The merged context contains an entry with key "key" and value "<level>"

    Examples:
      | level        |
      | API          |
      | Client       |
      | Invocation   |
      | Before Hooks |
