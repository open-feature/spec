# Appendix A: Included Utilities

This document contains requirements for auxiliary utilities provided by the SDK, such as testing utilities.

## In-memory provider

> Language-specific OpenFeature SDK implementations **SHOULD** expose an in-memory provider built into the SDK.

The in-memory provider is intended to be used for testing; SDK consumers may use it for their use cases.
Hence, the packaging, naming, and access modifiers must be set appropriately.

Given below are features this provider **MUST** support,

- Provider must be initiated with a pre-defined set of flags provided to a constructor
- Feature Flag structure must be minimal but should help to test OpenFeature specification
- EvaluationContext support should be provided through callbacks/lambda expressions
- Provider must support a means of updating flag values, resulting in the emission of `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED` events
- Provider must be maintained to support specification changes

## SDK end-to-end testing

> E2E tests must utilize [in-memory provider](#in-memory-provider) defined within the SDK and must be self-contained.

OpenFeature project maintains an end-to-end(e2e) test suite defined with [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).
These test definitions reside in [Appendix B](./appendix-b-gherkin-suites.md)
