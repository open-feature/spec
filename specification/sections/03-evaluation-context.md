# 3. Evaluation Context

[![experimental](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=experimental&color=orange)](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/tree/main/specification#experimental)

## Overview

The `evaluation context` provides ambient information for the purposes of flag evaluation. Contextual data may be used as the basis for targeting, including rule-based evaluation, overrides for specific subjects, or fractional flag evaluation.

The context might contain information about the end-user, the application, the host, or any other ambient data that might be useful in flag evaluation. For example, a flag system might define rules that return a specific value based on the user's email address, locale, or the time of day. The context provides this information. The context can be optionally provided at evaluation, and mutated in [before hooks](./04-hooks.md).

### 3.1 Fields

> [!NOTE]
> Field casing is not specified, and should be chosen in accordance with language idioms.

see: [types](../types.md)

#### Requirement 3.1.1

> The `evaluation context` structure **MUST** define an optional `targeting key` field of type string, identifying the subject of the flag evaluation.

The targeting key uniquely identifies the subject (end-user, or client service) of a flag evaluation. Providers may require this field for fractional flag evaluation, rules, or overrides targeting specific users. Such providers may behave unpredictably if a targeting key is not specified at flag resolution.

#### Requirement 3.1.2

> The evaluation context **MUST** support the inclusion of custom fields, having keys of type `string`, and values of type `boolean | string | number | datetime | structure`.

see: [structure](../types.md#structure), [datetime](../types.md#datetime)

#### Requirement 3.1.3

> The evaluation context **MUST** support fetching the custom fields by key and also fetching all key value pairs.

#### Requirement 3.1.4

> The evaluation context fields **MUST** have an unique key.

The key uniquely identifies a field in the `evaluation context` and it should be unique across all types to avoid any collision when marshalling the `evaluation context` by the provider.

### 3.2 Context levels and merging

#### Condition 3.2.1

> The implementation uses the dynamic-context paradigm.

see: [dynamic-context paradigm](../glossary.md#dynamic-context-paradigm)

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.1.1

> The API, Client and invocation **MUST** have a method for supplying `evaluation context`.

API (global) `evaluation context` can be used to supply static data to flag evaluation, such as an application identifier, compute region, or hostname. Client and invocation `evaluation context` are ideal for dynamic data, such as end-user attributes.

#### Condition 3.2.2

[![experimental](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=experimental&color=orange)](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/tree/main/specification#experimental)

> The implementation uses the static-context paradigm.

see: [static-context paradigm](../glossary.md#static-context-paradigm)

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.2.1

> The API **MUST** have a method for setting the global `evaluation context`.

API (global) `evaluation context` can be used to supply data to flag evaluation, such as (but not limited to) user name, email, or user organization membership changes.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.2.2

> The Client and invocation **MUST NOT** have a method for supplying `evaluation context`.

In the static-context paradigm, context is global. The client and invocation cannot supply evaluation context.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.2.3

> The API **MUST** have a method for setting `evaluation context` for a `domain`.

In the static-context paradigm, provider specific context can be set using the associated `domain`.
The global context is used if there is no matching provider specific context.

See [setting a provider](./01-flag-evaluation.md#setting-a-provider), [domain](../glossary.md#domain) for details.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.2.4

> The API **MUST** have a mechanism to manage `evaluation context` for an associated `domain`.

In the static-context paradigm, it's possible to create and remove provider-specific context.
See [setting a provider](./01-flag-evaluation.md#setting-a-provider), [domain](../glossary.md#domain) for details.

#### Requirement 3.2.3

> Evaluation context **MUST** be merged in the order: API (global; lowest precedence) -> transaction -> client -> invocation -> before hooks (highest precedence), with duplicate values being overwritten.

Any fields defined in the transaction `evaluation context` will overwrite duplicate fields defined in the global `evaluation context`, any fields defined in the client `evaluation context` will overwrite duplicate fields defined in the transaction `evaluation context`, and fields defined in the invocation `evaluation context` will overwrite duplicate fields defined globally or on the client. Any resulting `evaluation context` from a [before hook](./04-hooks.md#requirement-434) will overwrite duplicate fields defined globally, on the client, or in the invocation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    global("API (global)")
    transaction("Transaction")
    client("Client")
    invocation("Invocation")
    hook("Before Hooks")
    global --> transaction
    transaction --> client
    client --> invocation
    invocation --> hook
```

This describes the precedence of all `evaluation context` variants. Depending on the `paradigm`, not all variants might be available in an `SDK` implementation.

#### Condition 3.2.4

[![experimental](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=experimental&color=orange)](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/tree/main/specification#experimental)

> The implementation uses the static-context paradigm.

see: [static-context paradigm](../glossary.md#static-context-paradigm)

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.4.1

> When the global `evaluation context` is set, the `on context changed` function **MUST** run.

The SDK implementation must run the `on context changed` function on all registered provider that use the global `evaluation context` whenever it is mutated.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.2.4.2

> When the `evaluation context` for a specific provider is set, the `on context changed` function **MUST** only run on the associated provider.

The SDK implementation must run the `on context changed` function only on the provider that is scoped to the mutated `evaluation context`.

### 3.3 Context Propagation

[![experimental](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=experimental&color=orange)](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/tree/main/specification#experimental)

`Transaction context` is a container for transaction-specific `evaluation context` (e.g. user id, user agent, IP).
Transaction context can be set where specific data is available (e.g. an auth service or request handler) and by using the `transaction context propagator` it will automatically be applied to all flag evaluations within a transaction (e.g. a request or thread).

The following shows a possible TypeScript implementation using [AsyncLocalStorage (async_hooks)](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html):

```typescript
export class AsyncLocalStorageTransactionContext implements TransactionContextPropagator {
    private asyncLocalStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage<EvaluationContext>();

    getTransactionContext(): EvaluationContext {
        return this.asyncLocalStorage.getStore() ?? {};
    }
    setTransactionContext(context: EvaluationContext, callback: () => void): void {
        this.asyncLocalStorage.run(context, callback);
    }
}

/**
 * This example is based on an express middleware.
 */
app.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const ip = res.headers.get("X-Forwarded-For")
    OpenFeature.setTransactionContext({ targetingKey: req.user.id, ipAddress: ip }, () => {
        // The transaction context is used in any flag evaluation throughout the whole call chain of next 
        next();
    });
})
```

#### Condition 3.3.1

> The implementation uses the dynamic-context paradigm.

see: [dynamic-context paradigm](../glossary.md#dynamic-context-paradigm)

##### Conditional Requirement 3.3.1.1

> The API **SHOULD** have a method for setting a `transaction context propagator`.

If there already is a `transaction context propagator`, it is replaced with the new one. 

#### Condition 3.3.1.2

> The SDK implements context propagation.

A language may not have any applicable way of implementing `transaction context propagation` so the language SDK might not implement context propagation.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.3.1.2.1

> The API **MUST** have a method for setting the `evaluation context` of the `transaction context propagator` for the current transaction.

If a `transaction context propagator` is set, the SDK will call the [method defined in 3.3.1.3](#conditional-requirement-33122) with this `evaluation context` and so this `evaluation context` will be available during the current transaction.
If no `transaction context propagator` is set, this `evaluation context` is not used for evaluations.
This method then can be used for example in a request handler to add request-specific information to the `evaluation context`.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.3.1.2.2

> A `transaction context propagator` **MUST** have a method for setting the `evaluation context` of the current transaction.

A `transaction context propagator` is responsible for persisting context for the duration of a single transaction.
Typically, a transaction context propagator will propagate the context using a language-specific carrier such as [ThreadLocal (Java)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html), [async hooks (Node.js)](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html), [Context (Go)](https://pkg.go.dev/context) or another similar mechanism.

##### Conditional Requirement 3.3.1.2.3

> A `transaction context propagator` **MUST** have a method for getting the `evaluation context` of the current transaction.

This will be used by the SDK implementation when merging the context for evaluating a feature flag.

#### Condition 3.3.2

> The implementation uses the static-context paradigm.

see: [static-context paradigm](../glossary.md#static-context-paradigm)

##### Conditional Requirement 3.3.2.1

> The API **MUST NOT** have a method for setting a `transaction context propagator`.

In the static-context paradigm, context is global, so there must not be different contexts between transactions.
