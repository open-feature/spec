# Types and Data Structures

## Overview

This document outlines some of the common types and data structures defined by OpenFeature and referenced elsewhere in this specification.

### Boolean

A logical true or false, as represented idiomatically in the implementation languages.

### String

A UTF-8 encoded string.

### Number

A numeric value of unspecified type or size. Implementation languages may further differentiate between integers, floating point numbers, and other specific numeric types and provide functionality as idioms dictate.

### Structure

Structured data, presented however is idiomatic in the implementation language, such as JSON or YAML.

### Datetime

A language primitive for representing a date and time, optionally including timezone information. If no timezone is specified, the date and time will be treated as UTC.

### Evaluation Details

A structure representing the result of the [flag evaluation process](./glossary.md#evaluating-flag-values), and made available in the [detailed flag resolution functions](./sections/01-flag-evaluation.md#14-detailed-flag-evaluation), containing the following fields:

- flag key (string, required)
- value (boolean | string | number | structure, required)
- error code ([error code](#error-code), optional)
- error message (string, optional)
- reason (string, optional)
- variant (string, optional)
- flag metadata ([flag metadata](#flag-metadata))

> [!NOTE]  
> Some type systems feature useful constraints that can enhance the ergonomics of the `evaluation details` structure.
> For example, in the case of an unsuccessful evaluation, `error code`, `reason`, and `error message` will be set, and variant will not.
> If the type system of the implementation supports the expression of such constraints, consider defining them.

### Resolution Details

A structure which contains a subset of the fields defined in the `evaluation details`, representing the result of the provider's [flag resolution process](./glossary.md#resolving-flag-values), including:

- value (boolean | string | number | structure, required)
- error code ([error code](#error-code), optional)
- error message (string, optional)
- reason (string, optional)
- variant (string, optional)
- flag metadata ([flag metadata](#flag-metadata), optional)

A set of pre-defined reasons is enumerated below:

| Reason          | Explanation                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STATIC          | The resolved value is static (no dynamic evaluation).                                                                            |
| DEFAULT         | The resolved value fell back to a pre-configured value (no dynamic evaluation occurred or dynamic evaluation yielded no result). |
| TARGETING_MATCH | The resolved value was the result of a dynamic evaluation, such as a rule or specific user-targeting.                            |
| SPLIT           | The resolved value was the result of pseudorandom assignment.                                                                    |
| CACHED          | The resolved value was retrieved from cache.                                                                                     |
| DISABLED        | The resolved value was the result of the flag being disabled in the management system.                                           |
| UNKNOWN         | The reason for the resolved value could not be determined.                                                                       |
| STALE           | The resolved value is non-authoritative or possibly out of date                                                                  |
| ERROR           | The resolved value was the result of an error.                                                                                   |

> [!NOTE]  
> The `reason` should not be limited to the reasons enumerated above. It can be any of the pre-defined reasons, or
> any string value. Some type systems have features which can increase the ergonomics of `reason`, for instance a union
> of pre-defined types with a string, or a rust-style enumeration which allows for enumerated values to have associated
> content.

```rust
enum Reason {
    Static,
    Default,
    TargetingMatch,
    Split,
    Cached,
    Unknown,
    Stale,
    Error,
    Other(String)
}

let myReason = Reason::Other("my-reason".to_string());
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `resolution details` structure is not exposed to the Application Author.
> It defines the data which Provider Authors must return when resolving the value of flags.

### Error Code

An enumerated error code represented idiomatically in the implementation language.

| Error Code            | Explanation                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PROVIDER_NOT_READY    | The value was resolved before the provider was initialized.                                 |
| FLAG_NOT_FOUND        | The flag could not be found.                                                                |
| PARSE_ERROR           | An error was encountered parsing data, such as a flag configuration.                        |
| TYPE_MISMATCH         | The type of the flag value does not match the expected type.                                |
| TARGETING_KEY_MISSING | The provider requires a targeting key and one was not provided in the `evaluation context`. |
| INVALID_CONTEXT       | The `evaluation context` does not meet provider requirements.                               |
| PROVIDER_FATAL        | The provider has entered an irrecoverable error state.                                      |
| GENERAL               | The error was for a reason not enumerated above.                                            |

### Evaluation Context

- hooks (one or more [hooks](./sections/04-hooks.md), optional)
- hook hints ([hook hints structure](./sections/04-hooks.md#42-hook-hints), optional)

### Flag Metadata

A structure which supports definition of arbitrary properties, with keys of type `string`, and values of type `boolean`, `string`, or `number`.

This structure is populated by a provider for use by an [Application Author](./glossary.md#application-author) via the [Evaluation API](./glossary.md#evaluation-api) or an [Application Integrator](./glossary.md#application-integrator) via [hooks](./sections/04-hooks.md).

### Provider Status

An enumeration of possible provider states.

| Status       | Explanation                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NOT_READY    | The provider has not been initialized.                                                             |
| READY        | The provider has been initialized, and is able to reliably resolve flag values.                    |
| ERROR        | The provider is initialized but is not able to reliably resolve flag values.                       |
| STALE        | The provider's cached state is no longer valid and may not be up-to-date with the source of truth. |
| FATAL        | The provider has entered an irrecoverable error state.                                             |
| RECONCILING* | The provider is reconciling its state with a context change.                                       |

| Event                          | Explanation                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PROVIDER_READY                 | The provider is ready to perform flag evaluations.                                                                  |
| PROVIDER_ERROR                 | The provider signaled an error.                                                                                    |

| PROVIDER_STALE                 | The provider's cached state is no longer valid and may not be up-to-date with the source of truth.                  |
| PROVIDER_RECONCILING*          | The context associated with the provider has changed, and the provider has not yet reconciled its associated state. |
| PROVIDER_CONTEXT_CHANGED*      | The context associated with the provider has changed, and the provider has reconciled its associated state.         |

\* [static context (client-side) paradigm](./glossary.md#static-context-paradigm) only

### Handler Functions

A function or method which can be associated with a `provider event`, and runs when that event occurs.
It declares an `event details` parameter.

### Tracking Event Details

A structure which supports definition of arbitrary properties, including nested objects, similar to the `evaluation context` and object-typed flag values.

See [tracking event details](./sections/06-tracking.md#62-tracking-event-details), [evaluation context](#evaluation-context).
